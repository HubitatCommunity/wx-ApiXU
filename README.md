# Luxuriant
<p>
<h2> Hubitat Driver to calculates Lux / Illuminance attributea.</h2>
<p>
<b>-- == Release v1.6 == â€“</b>
<p>
Added support for DarkSky.net to acquire cloud cover values.
<p>
Luxuriant uses your Hub's Latitude, Longitude and Time/Time Zone to calculate a 'slice of day' and thus
the angle of the sun. Assuming a max Outdoor Lux of 10000 the sun's angle is factored in to produce a value taht would be roughly equivilant to a cloudless day. Optionally, adding a DarkSky key will allow for your local / regional cloud cover value to also be factored into the calculation.
